# Mapping Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to create a map that shows major earthquakes during the past 7 days and the tectonic plates that are around the areas. The map has multiple layers and filters that allow users to change between threee different map styles as well as filters to add or remove the markers. The marker size and color is representative of the earthquake magnitude. This was all completed using Javascript and Leaflet.
